    * Resolved `jaraco.context` vulnerability.
    * Fixed Test Suite (8/8 Passed).
    * Corrected XML Extraction Logic (Invoice ID vs URN).
2. **Commercial Assets Ready**:
    * **Video**: `facturx_demo_flow_final.webp` recorded and embedded in `walkthrough.md`.

3. **Documentation Cleaned**: Obsolete docs moved to `ARCHIVE`.

## ⏸️ Paused / To Decide

1. **Public Pricing Visibility**: We prepared `README.md` to show "Scale" tier, but decided **NOT** to push it yet. User wants to reflect on the strategy for the "Scale" offer visibility.
2. **Next Steps**: SEO Article vs Pyodide usage.

## 📝 Status

* Local codebase is ahead of remote (Docs changes staged but not pushed).
* Lemon Squeezy activation email is ready to send.
